Technically it is quite easy to read, in fact it is plain JSON just it is
- compressed
- binary encoded with SMILE
for space and performance reasons, so it is quite easy to read.
It consist out of two JSON documents
- a one liner so I know whether it is compressed and I sue smile and the version number
- the rest

so quite easy to decode. The file itself should be more or less understandable.
